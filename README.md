# taylorclay.dev

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, [taylorclay.dev](https://www.taylorclay.dev/)!

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a popular React framework created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Next.js allows for easy development and deployment of server-rendered React applications.

In addition to Next.js, this website also utilizes [Compiled](https://compiledcssinjs.com/), a CSS-in-JS library created by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). Compiled allows for the creation of modular and maintainable CSS styles, seamlessly integrated with the rest of the JavaScript codebase.

Thank you for visiting my website and exploring its source code. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback.
